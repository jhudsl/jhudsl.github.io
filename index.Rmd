We have previously built massive online open courses in data science that have enrolled more than 8 million people around the world, published best selling books, widely-subscribed blogs, and podcasts on data science, statistics, and academia, and have developed the swirl software platform for interactive learning of statistics in R. We make our impact by combining cutting edge research in machine learning, artificial intelligence and statistics with a deep understanding of applications and an eye toward the human behavioral component of data analysis.
