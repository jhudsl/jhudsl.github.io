We currently have five active and on-going projects in JHU DaSL 
include projects ranging in topics from education, research, 
tech development, media and outreach.

## Open Online Courses 

A major educational initiative of the JHU DaSL is to create 
[open-source online courses](courses.html) delivered through a range of platforms 
including Youtube, Github, Leanpub, and Coursera. We currently
have four active MOOC programs that you can enroll in at any time.
Join over 8 million other students in taking a course produced by 
the Johns Hopkins Data Science Lab! For more information, check out 
our [what MOOCs we are working on here](courses.html).

For example, check out our most recent course released on Coursera in December 2020 on [Tidyverse Skills for Data Science in R](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tidyverse-data-science-r)!

## Open Case Studies

Despite unprecedented and growing interest in data science on
campuses, there are few courses and course materials that 
provide meaningful opportunity for students to learn about 
real-world challenges. Most courses provide unrealistically 
clean data sets that fit the assumptions of the methods in
an unrealistic way. The result is that students are left 
unable to effectively analyze data and solve real-world 
challenges outside of the classroom.

To address this problem, we are developing [Open Case Studies](https://www.opencasestudies.org) (OCS), 
an educational resource of case studies that educators 
can use in the classroom to teach students how to effectively
derive knowledge from data. This resource will be accessible 
to educators across the world to teach students how to 
analyze data and solve challenges with data. 

This project was selected as a High-Impact Project in 2019-2020 by the [Bloomberg American Health Initiative](https://americanhealth.jhu.edu) and [Bloomberg Philanthropies](https://www.bloomberg.org/).

## Cloud-based Data Science

[Cloud-Based Data Science](https://www.clouddatascience.org) (CBDS) 
consists of two parts. One, a set of pay-what-you-want (including free!)
massive open online courses that can be completed on any computer 
with a web browser and an internet connection.

Two, Cloud-Based Data Science Plus (CBDS+) is a no-cost, paid 
14-week educational initiative for young-adult, high school and
GED-graduates in Baltimore City. Offered by the Johns Hopkins 
Bloomberg School of Public Health, in partnership with the
Historic East Baltimore Community Action Coalition and Leanpub, 
CBDS+ aims to equip members of surrounding communities with the
necessary skills and support required to work in the booming 
field of data science.

We aim to equip individuals from underserved populations with 
the necessary skills and support required to work in the field 
of data science. A portion of anything you pay for the online
courses supports the CBDS+ program.

## Technology Development 

Developing technology and software is a major focus of the 
JHU DaSL team.

## Data Science for American Health Conference

We will host a Data Science for American Health conference
at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2020 
to bring together data scientists to tackle and address 
public health challenges. More information coming soon!
